What is this program? It says that it's like a prepaid program where you can freeze your tuition fees. But I'll be graduating this semester, so I wanted to know if I can use this at all.Anyone have an idea what this is?5 commentsshareall 5 commentssorted by: best–IsAnAlpacaAero (alumni) 1 point 5 hours ago You pay for tuition by semester now, then in a decade or so the program pays the school for those semesters.permalink–BMOtheCutiePieS 1 point 4 hours ago Got it. Thanks for clarification!permalinkparent–lecalec 1 point 4 hours ago College Illinois! is a 529 prepaid tuition plan. Parents usually enroll and prepay college tuition at today's cost for their children when they are typically still kids so that by the time they graduate high school they have a college plan ready for them.I don't think you can use it if you're graduating now. But you could buy it for your kids in the future.permalink–BMOtheCutiePieS 1 point 4 hours ago I guess it's beneficial for families who would for certain know that they will stay in Illinois in the future. Thanks for letting me know!permalinkparent–AfterEarlyAlum 2 points 3 hours ago The program will fund just about any college, but you get the most bang for your buck by attending an Illinois public U. If the kid attends a college outside the 13 or so public Universitie in Illinois, they simply are reimbursed the average tuition of the Illinois publics. So if you choose to attend Michigan, for some ungodly reason, College Illinois will give you $13k or so a year toward that tuition.It serves no purpose for current students, who already have their tuition locked.

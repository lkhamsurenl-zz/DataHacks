I'm a freshman. Now before you upperclass men roast me, please consider what it would mean to both you and me if a little part of your great and legendary knowledge/intelligence could be passed down to a freshie like me in need of a cooler room. I have 2 fans but no AC and being the sheltered suburban white boy that I am, I cannot stand heat at all, in fact I could not even sleep last night because of it. I plead for any noble and generous people to provide me advice on cooling the hellish kingdom that is...

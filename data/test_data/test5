I am 25 yo immigrant developer with around 5.5 years of experience in software engineering (2.5 years developing 3d applications using C/C++/STL back in my home country and around 3 years in MSFT working on business applications). I do not have any industry experience with "sexy" technologies like big data or full stack development (I took couple of online courses on that). I like functional programming and statistics, I also took several online courses on that, I also took couple of courses on JS and Python. I feel really tired and unmotivated with my current job, I noticed I am not growing and not building the skills I'd like to build, though I am paid decently. Essentially, I am not happy with it and I am burning out. I am thinking about changing jobs to some other company where I can learn more about topics I like and where I can get some commercial experience with them. But I am worried about not having previous experience in these topics, which is often a requirement, so in a sense I am afraid itâ€™s going to be hard for me to find a decent job. What would my best course of action be? Any opinion appreciated.

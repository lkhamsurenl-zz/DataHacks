I am debating whether I should retake differential equations in order to do a grade replacement this semester. I took it last semester but I ended the course with a C-. I’m majoring in mechanical engineering and I still have to take linear equations after deferential equations. Right now I am registered for both classes (linear and differential equations), so getting into the class is not a problem. I was told I can go onto linear but not sure about it.I’m worried about falling behind of where I’m supposed to be. I transferred into UIUC last semester with a 3.54 GPA and now I have 3.47 GPA and I’m afraid of it going any lower. I really don’t know what to do. I’d appreciate any advice. Thank you.4 commentsshareall 4 commentssorted by: best–Ymfp 2 points 10 hours ago A C- in Diffy Q won't lose you any job offers. Leave it in the past. You have a good GPA. Do better in other classes and you'll be fine.permalink–DJGingivitisCEE-Structural Grad 2 points 9 hours ago Your GPA is good. Anything over a 3.2 in engineering is awesome. Below that and you might start having companies through your resume in the maybe or not pile. But focus on other things that are more important. Don't retake it.permalink–SulfuricSomedayUndergrad ChemE 2 points 10 hours ago Don't bother it's a waste of time. Your GPA is fine.permalink–mgs1otacon 1 point 3 hours ago Don't bother. Also linear doesn't really use anything from diff eq anyway.

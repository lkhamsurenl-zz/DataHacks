Most companies are equal opportunity employers, so in theory, no. Realistically, everybody has their own biases and those undoubtedly play a role in decision making. So, yes.permalink–MusaTheRedGuardLooking for job 22 points 6 hours ago If you're asking specifically about the Race/Gender/Veteran Status/Disability thing on application forms, I don't think managers get to see that.But in a more general sense, do race and gender make a difference? Absolutely they do. People have biases.permalink–mingp 21 points 7 hours ago This information is typically not presented to hiring managers. Rather, it is used after the fact by the human resources department for internal quality control, analytics, and auditing purposes, as well as potentially regulatory compliance. In other words, it's pretty much just paperwork.permalink–csquestionsyoS 2 points 6 hours ago Should I just repost the question then?permalinkparent–mrmuagi 1 point 2 hours ago Why? You have a ton of great answers in this thread.permalinkparent–_Aggron 14 points 6 hours ago Mentioning it absolutely does not help. No one who is part of the decision process would see that information as reported by the applicant. Mentioning that you're 1/16 Cherokee won't do anything for you.That said, latent sexism and racial bias as components to an office culture is real.permalink–luthageGameplay Engineer 4 points 3 hours ago* As others have said, I don't believe that they get that information. However, there have been studies where the exact same resume is considered differently based on the gender or race of the name due to ingrained bias.permalink–xxdeathx 3 points 5 hours ago The race/gender part of your application that you fill out isnt shown to anyone considering to interview you, but they can still see your name and make assumptions based on that.permalink–DevIceManEngineer, Mathematician, Artist 2 points 5 hours ago Generally no, but companies in the us may be more likely to hire minorities for tax breaks, to avoid lawsuits, or comply with eeo requirements .permalink–csc9000 1 point 5 hours ago I've seen many cases where gender has been a benefit. A lot of companies will take a female candidate over a male one if all else is equal though I've also seen cases where less qualified female candidates have been hired due to team diversity. I've never seen race make any difference at all during the hiring process. All of these observations are from SF based companies.permalink–SmartassRemarks 9 points 5 hours ago I've worked with people who would shy away from taking a female candidate due to stereotypes. It works both ways and it depends on the person deciding.permalinkparent–csc9000 2 points 4 hours ago Definitely true as well, the answer as always is "it depends"permalinkparent–dinosaurdynasty 2 points 3 hours ago I remember seeing a study around that suggested, all else being equal, a woman in STEM was twice as likely to be hired than a man.permalinkparent–wutcnbrowndo4u 4 points 2 hours ago Here's the study. It was in STEM academia.https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/32hlpc/national_hiring_experiments_reveal_21_faculty/permalinkparent–Vadoff 2 points 7 hours ago No, don't think it will help or hurt.permalink–csquestionsyoS 1 point 7 hours ago Are you a hiring manager?permalinkparent–strathmeyer 8 points 7 hours ago Hiring managers to not get access to that information.permalinkparent–csquestionsyoS 4 points 7 hours ago Oh oops, sorry. I'm not sure who does. I guess the question is just more like does it even make a difference, and not just directed at hiring managers.permalinkparent–utuxia 1 point 3 hours ago This is true. Most managers I know can't tell the difference between man and woman or white vs. black. So no. They do not get that information /s.permalinkparent–Vadoff 3 points 5 hours ago Nope.permalinkparent–bgeeky 2 points 5 hours ago I've been a hiring manager for several companies and those factors have never been a consideration.permalink–deelowe 1 point 3 hours ago Some companies have diversity initiatives where they attempt to encourage bringing in more diversity candidates. A hypothetical example is that they may bring in more marginal female candidates. Doesn't mean they'll get hired, but the chances of diversity candidates at least making it to a resume screen or even an interview is certainly higher at some companies.permalink–PM_ME_UR_OBSIDIAN 1 point 2 hours ago I've heard a manager at an old job comment on "diversity candidates" - think women, black people, flamboyantly gay men - saying that hiring managers had to be very careful about hiring them, because if they ever had to fire them they were liable to raise hell, file discrimination suits, etc.I'm personally all for diversity - the best teams I've been in were multi-ethnic and equally gendered.permalink–mbalooking 1 point 2 hours ago Yes, it matters. But that doesn't mean there's a universal answer to how it matters.What I want to see is someone that can make me a believer they will add value to the team and company.There is a hard truth many hiring managers won't talk about. If you built a team that by design or happenstance is monolithic, you could end up handcuffing yourself later when a strong candidate happens to have a different background. Why? Because culture fits matter a lot.It ain't right, it just is.permalink–anihilistlol 2 points 4 hours ago It makes it easier to get a job or internship at larger companies like Microsoft, Google, Apple, Facebook, etc., because of hiring quotas for minorities and women.permalink–nikroux 1 point 3 hours ago I know it doesn't hurt me to mention how exotic I am despite looking white on an off chance that the company needs to fulfil diversity

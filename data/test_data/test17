Has anyone had any experience golfing at the Illini golf course in Savoy? I really want to play a round, and this place seems to offer the best (I.e. cheapest) price for 18 holes. How's the condition of the course, how'd you get there with your clubs, friendly game wardens?8 commentsshareall 8 commentssorted by: best–feelthegleeGrad Student, Physics 3 points 18 hours ago As for getting there, you have 10 days until the AirBus/27 stops service.permalink–iarepookieS 1 point 16 hours ago Tragic.. is 27 airbus the only bus that takes you there? Or just the quickest?permalinkparent–feelthegleeGrad Student, Physics 2 points 16 hours ago* The AirBus goes to Willard Airport, and drives right past the entrance to the golf course. If you ask they'd probably drop you off at that entrance, but I don't know how far ofa walk it would be from there.Edit: the next closest bus would get yout to the Savoy Walmart, but that's still about a mile away.permalinkparent–SwaggyVCommunication 4 points 14 hours ago* Actually the Savoy Walmart backs right up to the course there's just a fence and trees in between but there's a break in them at the far southwest corner of the lot that leads right into the golf course parking lot. I assume from many other students taking the bus there.(edit) Here's a picture to give you an idea of where it is http://imgur.com/JeOMalDpermalinkparent–feelthegleeGrad Student, Physics 1 point 14 hours ago Oh cool!permalinkparent–turbo86 2 points 15 hours ago Depending on how strong of a player you are, definitely play the Orange. Blue plays pretty short and can turn in to a drive-pitch-putt course on a few holes.The condition is generally ok, and the greens can get going pretty quick if there's not been rain and the wind's been howling. About the wind: it gets pretty brutal at times, so beware of that before heading out. I've had par 5's that I've hit in two turn in to driver-3 wood-5 wood with a shift in wind direction.The rangers and staff are nice enough and generally stay out of the way. Pace of play can get a bit hairy if you catch up to a certain type of group, but we can talk about that via PM if you'd like.All of that said, Stone Creek is the better course, and I do believe good deals can be had on certain days/times. If you have a car or can split the Uber with someone, I'd recommend Stone Creek over Orange and Blue. Orange and Blue is fun for what it is, though.Enjoy!permalink–DJGingivitisCEE-Structural Grad 1 point 17 hours ago Been there a few times. Nice enough course. Maybe not the most challenging but if your are looking for a cheap round go there. You can also rent clubs for like 7 or 10 bucks.permalink–nodea5 1 point 16 hours ago This place is definitely the cheapest 18 hole public course in CU. Course conditions aren't bad. We're in the dog days of summer so it's drying out, the fairways are firming up and the greens held few shots when I last played about a week ago. It is pretty crowded most of the time though, however. The Orange course is the tougher of the two courses, with pitched greens and bent grass fairways. The blue is much easier, with flatter greens and fewer doglegs. I have my own vehicle so club transport has never been an issue with me. I thought there was bus service that took you out to the airport although I don't know how far into the golf course or neighboring subdivision that can take you in. (If that even exists)

I'm a new student and I am commuting to U of I every day from 30 minutes away. Due to this I have to stay in CU all day without the luxury of just going back to my dorm or whatever between classes. Does anyone have any suggestions of good places to pass time or even cool things to do between classes?4 commentsshareall 4 commentssorted by: best–snakesarecoolAlma has abandoned us 1 point 2 hours ago How long are your breaks and what area of campus are you going to be in?permalink–english-23 1 point 2 hours ago During the warmer months, you can hang out on the quad(s) and catch up with friends or your studying/homework or just simply relax. There's always the union and the coffee/break area in the middle. You can explore other buildings on campus.permalink–Lavendre 1 point 2 hours ago Hey! I also live off campus. I usually hangout in the library (Main or Undergrad) or chill in the Union. Honestly, people study anywhere and everywhere on campus. If you get tired head to the union; always tons of people napping between classes. You'll figure it out as you go along so don't stress too much about what you'll do with your free time. Definitely consider going to office hours since you'll be around anyways!permalink–yogurtcup1 1 point 2 hours ago Yah some of my favorites places to study/procrastinate:Grainger LibraryIllini UnionStarbucks on Green StAnd for stuff to do between classes, it really depends on your interests.

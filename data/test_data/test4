I currently have a catastrophic 2.55 in (pure) mathematics at a top Canadian institution. I'll be in my fourth year this fall and will be doing an extra semester to salvage my GPA but to be realistic, I am not getting into any graduate school.I know I'll be having an extra difficult time to find a job, but I am aspiring to become a data analyst - a kind of a software developer who uses more math and stats. Upon graduation, I will have taken intermediate level courses in data structures, object-oriented programming, and numerical analysis.I am under the impression, it is fairly easy to get a job in software development, statistics indicates that there twice as much demand as supply. How is the job prospect of data analysis, however? I've seen two groups of postings, one that only require a BS in any quantitative discipline, one that requires MS or above with preference given to CS or statistics majors. How different are data analysts from traditional statisticians? Are pure math majors prepared and competitive?1 commentshareall 1 commentssorted by: bestâ€“ExtrasolarEarth 1 point 4 hours ago Learn SQL. You'll be fine.

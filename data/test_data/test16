I am a returning student and I am getting myself back into cycling. There are a lot of country roads nearby with some real beautiful scenery including a wind farm. Anyway, I am looking to see if anyone would be interested in getting some group rides together to go exploring and get some exercise too!1 commentshareall 1 commentssorted by: bestâ€“bubrahucize 2 points 12 hours ago Additionally you can participate in the Prairie Cycle Club Weekly Rides:They become show and go rides starting about now each year. Typically the ride will have folks who know road conditions and good routes based on wind and daylight hours which can be important facts if you are not used to riding around here.http://www.prairiecycleclub.org/2001-weekly-rides/Note non-PCC rides at the bottom.

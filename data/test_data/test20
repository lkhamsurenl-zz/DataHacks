I'm a freshman here and I am wondering if theres cheaper place to buy electronics other than the bookstore, best buy, or even walmart?4 commentsshareall 4 commentssorted by: best–english-23 3 points 15 hours ago I would recommend online. I don't know of any that'd be cheaper with a physical locationpermalink–narwhalateegrad physics 1 point 14 hours ago Bestbuy has a $150 discount right now for students.permalinkparent–szaeroEE, CS 2 points 13 hours ago Unless you want a Mac, I highly recommend the signature series laptops from the Microsoft Store online. No questions asked 30 day return policy, no crapware installed, usually cheaper, and they have education discounts.permalink–Subestella 0 points 16 hours ago Tech zone in the union usually has discounts for students. I know you mentioned places other than best buy, but right now they have $100 off Macs deal going on right now. I just got a new MacBook Air for 750.

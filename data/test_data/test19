I'm a freshman in ECE, and I am currently enrolled in PHYS 100. I've heard PHYS 100 is pretty much a joke (from old posts on this subreddit), but my hold was just lifted. Should I get rid of my cushy, starting at 10 AM everyday schedule in order to take a harder physics class? I already have 15 credit hours and I'll have 17 if I switch into PHYS 211.Backstory: I was pretty strong at Physics in HS, but my teacher was horrible and the class was a joke. Will I be doing myself a disservice by not switching into 211? Also, I talked to my advisor and she thinks I should take 100.ThanksEDIT: Dropped 100, added 2114 commentsshareall 4 commentssorted by: best–Riddlrcompe 3 points 11 hours ago ur advisor is dumbtake 211.permalink–trazz32S 1 point 11 hours ago Think 17 credits is too much? Should I drop the IEFX research course I'm taking to bring it down to 15?permalinkparent–Riddlrcompe 3 points 10 hours ago I wouldn't first semester, but I would keep your schedule like that. add 211 and then decide after a week or so whether you want to drop anything.permalinkparent–trazz32S 2 points 10 hours ago Good idea. Just dropped 100 and added 211 with almost no shifting around. Thanks for your help!

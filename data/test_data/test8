I was wondering how often you professional devs out there are stuck waiting on responses from other devs about their programs/utilities.Maybe its because I work in embedded systems but I find a majority of my work goes: Find a problem with said software/utility for unit > Message dev who is in charge of said software/utility (I don't have source code access) > Wait endlessly on response to what they think is solution for said problem.This is the least favorite part of my job, I would rather be coding or implementing or even bug fixing my own code/application. It's not that I don't want to talk to devs, its that I feel I waste so much time and energy doing this and really it comes down to "I'm stuck please help me" kind of feeling that even when they come and fix the problem its definitely not satisfying because I didn't fix it.2 commentsshareall 2 commentssorted by: best–Treasy 1 point 5 hours ago You need to have a good understanding of the codebase to solve your problems. I see no reason that you should not have access to source if you are troubleshooting it as part of your job.I hope there's documentation for your system. Working in embedded its important to have a solid understanding of how the different parts of the system interact with one another.After they solve the problem for you, is it something you could've solved with the resources at your disposal (including doing more research), or something only the dev could solvepermalink–throwawayshampoo_ 1 point 5 hours ago Does your company employ any sort of stringent version/release control guidelines? Like, do you guys not do code review?

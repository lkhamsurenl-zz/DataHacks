If anyone else is in the process of filling out this form or has filled it out, I have a question. I am on the part where you have to check boxes for existing skills and experience. First of all, should I check coding AND design, or just coding? Will only checking coding penalize me in some way?Second of all, under the "Computer science disciplines with existing skills/experience" part, A lot of these things that are listed (robotics, networking, data mining, web apps, mobile systems, etc..) are things that I have a little bit of experience with but no real in depth knowledge, and they are asking me to select the ones that I am comfortable being interviewed on. Now, I have asked the recruiter and she said these things would be covered in the host matching interviews, so I'm wondering, for anyone that has gone through the host matching process, how rigorous are they? Do they really grill you on various data mining algorithms or networks protocols or whatever, or is it just a conversation to see if you are interested in the project or not?Thanks all.4 commentsshareall 4 commentssorted by: best–AggieDG17 1 point 3 hours ago Where'd you find this form?permalink–Thounumber1S 1 point 2 hours ago It was sent to me, the recruiter told me I had to fill it outpermalinkparent–viravain 1 point 2 hours ago Don't fret over the difference between coding, design, algorithms, and whatever else is there; it's not a big deal. Also, as a rule, interns are terrible at designing software. e: that is to say yeah mark design, why notAs for your second question, it depends on the host. The vast majority are just trying to get you interested in their project. Hosts with unusually specific or challenging projects might quiz you about your skills and experience. Very few actually ask challenging questions.permalink–jordanminjie 1 point 2 hours ago Hey I'm just finishing my Google internship, today was my last day and also obviously I'm not speaking for the company. I don't think you'll be penalized for putting just coding and not design. Secondly, the host interviews are just whatever the host decides she wants to talk about. I went through three total before I found my project which I really enjoyed. Only one of them was technical. For some projects, like those involving machine learning, you're mostly guaranteed that the host will ask some technical questions. I would say try to represent your skill set as honestly as you can but err on the side of overselling your abilities. Not as a general rule, but since this questionnaire basically is what hosts look at before deciding they want to talk to you, so the host can always decide later that they don't want you on their project.

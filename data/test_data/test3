Do employers value prior military experience? (self.cscareerquestions)submitted 2 hours ago by Arnie_MaxSo I am currently in Air Force ROTC, and will be serving at least four years in the Cyber Systems Operations Field in the Air Force after I get my BS in Computer Science. My question is, will software or IT employers view this as a positive or negative use of time? I'm not sure what exactly I will be doing in this field, but I will have leadership experience and somewhat of a relevant background in either discipline.

When you get your security clearance be sure to use that to your advantage after you're out and apply for contractor or other jobs that need it before it expirespermalink–IAmAmbitious 1 point an hour ago* Ahhh, good ol' 17D.

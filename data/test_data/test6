Best piece of advice I can give you.... keep your eye on the prize - or remember why you do it. It can get boring if you let it but testing is a very important job. It is always best you find an issue in lab then a customer in the field.permalink–reasonablemanzachS 1 point 3 hours ago Thanks so much for the tip.

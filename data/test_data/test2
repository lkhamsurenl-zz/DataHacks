Hey guys, I started a new web dev job 2 weeks ago in a Jr capacity and I can already tell that it is not a good fit for me. I've worked in the web dev industry for 3 years now, previously in a different capacity (I'm being vague about my job description in case my employer comes across this post) and have transitioned roles over the last few years so I knew what to expect in regards to long hours, lack of sleep, etc.Some of the major issues that I face: I was shown an all star (English speaking) dev team and amazing products when I had my on site. The reality of my new job is that I am on a different team (even a different sub-company) and I am the only one fluent in English so communication is an issue. The language/culture barrier also causes me to feel very alienated. I've tried to fit in but the relationship doesn't seem to click. I am also being asked to perform some unethical tasks as part of my daily duties. I have already had issues getting paid on time. My employer has also decided to misclassify me as an independent contractor to avoid taxes, unemployment insurance, etc. I have serious doubts about the amount of time that the company that I am working for will exist (they have funding issues). I am certain that I will not last long here so I feel that it is in my and my employer's best interest if we terminate our relationship now.My question is: how bad will this look to future employers? I don't plan to put this on a resume, since I haven't gained any experience from this. I realize however that a future employer may discover this two week period through a background check and ask me about it. So I am not sure if leaving it off of the resume is the best option. I am also not sure how it will look to a future employer that "This guy got a Jr dev job and quit after two weeks". If asked about this, I am not sure how to respond.Is this going to be harmful to my career? If so, what can I do to reduce the harmful impact? I've been freelancing for the last year so explaining a lengthy gap in employment history wouldn't be hard.TL;DR - Just got new dev job two weeks ago; already extremely unhappy and I know it wont last. Will quitting after 2 weeks be career suicide?10 commentsshareall 10 commentssorted by: best–MaximusLeonis 26 points 5 hours ago So the job was misrepresented? Easily explained away. On top of that being asked to perform unethical things? Nope.Not getting paid? Yea, fuck that shit.Get out. Leave it off your resume, if an employer ever asks you about it say they asked you to do something that comprised basic engineering ethics. You'll never have a problem with it. BUT LEAVE NOW!The longer you stay the harder it will be to explain.permalink–HowNowBrownShoes 2 points 37 minutes ago Agreed. Leave it off your resume, it won't come up. 2 weeks is a tiny gap.permalinkparent–Vadoff 13 points 5 hours ago Just don't put it on the resume, mention it on your linkedin, or use any references from that experience. There's no way a future employer will ever know about it. It won't affect your career.permalink–seanrowens 6 points 5 hours ago Don't walk away from this job. Run. But line up a new job first.permalink–VividLotus 4 points 4 hours ago You don't have to put every job you've ever had on a background check or application form. I mean, think about it: if we did, then most of us would be listing stuff like the crappy bakery where we worked in high school, or the work-study job unrelated to our career that we had in college, and nobody does that. While I'm admittedly not 100% sure if extremely vigilant employers would go through the effort of somehow polling tax records to find out about jobs a candidate omitted, if they do that, then it's definitely never come up for me. I don't have any career-track jobs that I omit from my resume or any other form, but I have unrelated jobs before and after my college internship that I've never listed on anything.Let's say you're applying for a job that somehow does find out about this brief job, though, unlikely as that is. All you'd have to tell them is what you told us here. It's not like you're considering quitting this job for a narcissistic or whiny or unrealistic or lazy reason; you're quitting it for, among other things, ethical reasons.If I were in your shoes I'd quit right now and not even worry about it.permalink–s0n3xus210S 2 points 3 hours ago Thank you guys for the advice! I feel much more confident about my decision to leave this company.permalink–wolf2600 2 points 2 hours ago My employer has also decided to misclassify me as an independent contractor to avoid taxes, unemployment insurance, etc.wat? That's a major issue. When you signed the employment paperwork, this didn't raise a red flag?permalink–ascendantlogic 1 point 4 hours ago Get out ASAP. Aside from the unethical stuff, the if they can't get you paid then it's time to bounce.permalink–sandwhale- 1 point 3 hours ago am also being asked to perform some unethical tasks as part of my daily duties.I have already had issues getting paid on time. My employer has also decided to misclassify me as an independent contractor to avoid taxes, unemployment insurance, etc.Those are fine enough reasons to quit. I wouldn't even put those 2 weeks in the resume. If you insist on putting it on your resume, you can just say you were an independent contract for 2 weeks... since that's what you were classified as one. But honestly, 2 weeks is a blip.permalink–bradfordmaster 1 point 2 hours ago Two weeks is such a short time it won't look at all suspicious on a resume. Many people I know spend longer than that unemployed between jobs just to take a bit of a break.Also, that place sounds horrible and what they are doing sounds illegal. If you wanted to, you could go after them for misclassifying you. I probably wouldn't bother though, I'd just pack up all of your stuff, go to you manager, and explain that you are quitting and why, then leave that day.
